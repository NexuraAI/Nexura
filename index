        <h1 class="heading-2"><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-2"><strong>Rising Fraud Risk:</strong> Businesses, banks, e-commerce platforms, and crypto
            projects are seeing a steady increase in fraudulent transactions, leading to financial losses and
            operational disruption.<strong><br />Limitations of Traditional Methods:</strong> Existing fraud detection
            systems are often rule-based, manual, or lack the ability to detect emerging fraud patterns, leading to
            delayed responses and inaccurate assessments.<br />‍<strong>User Experience:</strong> Fraud detection
            systems can sometimes result in false positives, flagging legitimate transactions and creating friction for
            customers and users.</p>
        <h1 class="heading-2"><strong>Technology Overview</strong></h1>
        <p>Nexura AI Agent employs advanced AI and machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities by analyzing
            transaction data in real-time. The system is designed to improve accuracy, reduce false positives, and
            provide actionable insights.<br /><br />‍<strong>3.1 Machine Learning Algorithms</strong>Nexura AI Agent
            leverages machine learning models trained on a large and diverse set of real-world transaction data (such as
            data from Kaggle) to identify patterns and anomalies associated with fraudulent
            behavior.<br />‍<strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The system uses labeled data (e.g., historical
            fraudulent transactions) to train models that can classify transactions as fraudulent or
            legitimate.<br />‍<strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Through unsupervised learning, Nexura AI Agent
            identifies unusual patterns in transactions that deviate from normal behavior, often indicative of
            fraud.<br />‍<strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> The system extracts and analyzes key features such as
            transaction amounts, user behavior, IP address location, and device information to detect fraud in
            real-time.<br /><br />‍<strong>3.2 Real-Time Transaction Analysis<br />‍</strong>By integrating directly
            with payment systems and e-commerce platforms, Nexura AI Agent analyzes every transaction in real-time,

            decision-making.<br /><br />‍<strong>3.3 Natural Language Processing (NLP)<br />‍</strong>The AI chatbot
            interface uses NLP techniques to communicate with users, providing clear and concise fraud risk assessments
            and security recommendations. This interaction makes fraud prevention accessible and easy for everyone, even
